Git Fetch: fetch gets all the change history of a tracked branch/repo.

So, on your local Git, fetch updates to see what has changed on GitHub:

1. git fetch origin
2. git status





Git Merge: merge combines the current branch, with a specified branch.

We have confirmed that the updates are as expected, and we can merge our current branch (master) with origin/master:

1. git merge origin/master
2. git status





Git Pull: pull is a combination of fetch and merge. It is used to pull all changes from a remote repository into the branch you are working on.

Use pull to update our local Git:

1. git pull origin
2. git status
